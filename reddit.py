## On a web server, this would happen on your server, but we have to pull the token out so we can use it for a request inside a script we're running on a personal computer (with connection to internet)
## Anytime we want to get new data we have to do this -- so a caching system would have to take this into account any time the data expired.
## And for that -- we'd want to think about the API rate limits, primarily!

# Now we can just use the get method on the oauth2session instance from here on out to make requests to spotify endpoints. Token will work for any endpoint, as long as it's still valid. (How long it is will depend from API to API)

###########
## Of course, this code does not have a caching setup,
## NOR does it have a set of useful functions --
## This is simply showing the process of managing an OAuth2Session.

## HOWEVER, the process here is actually simpler than ONE (not all) of the ways to address dealing with OAuth1 Protocol, though in the background, it is more in depth.

## NOTE: If not using oauth2, and you just need to extract a code from the URL, you can try something sort of like this... it is pretty ugly parsing of a URL, but it might get the job done:
# parts = authorization_response.split('?')
# query_parts = parts[1].split('&')
# code = ""
# for part in query_parts:
#     if part[:len("access_token")] == "access_token=":
#         code = part[5:]
# print(code) # or whatever you need to use it for
